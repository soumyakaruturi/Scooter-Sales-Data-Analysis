# Scooter Sales Data Analytics

This repository focuses on data analysis and visualization using Microsoft Excel. The raw sales data was cleaned by removing duplicates, handling null values, and standardizing number formats. The dataset was then transformed into a structured table for easier manipulation and analysis.

# Business Questions

The analysis was designed to answer key business questions related to sales performance and revenue distribution:

1. Sales by Salesperson

A pivot table was created to display sales performance by salesperson, grouped by state.

Metrics included:

Total Clients

Average Sales per Client

Total Sales per Salesperson

An interactive slicer was added for quick filtering by salesperson.

2. Sales by State

A separate pivot table was developed to organize sales data by state with improved clarity.

Key metrics included:

Total Sales

Average Sales per Client

Total Commission Earned

An additional slicer was included for state-level filtering.

# Excel Dashboard

The findings were consolidated into an interactive Excel Dashboard that highlights key insights through:

Pivot Tables

Pivot Bar Charts with Slicers

A Pie Chart showing Sales Revenue by State

This dashboard allows stakeholders to quickly filter, explore, and interpret sales performance across different dimensions.
